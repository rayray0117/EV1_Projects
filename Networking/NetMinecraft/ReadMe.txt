Known Issues:
Code is currently messy. Original game was made during the second mod (2-3 months of guildhall) with only single player in mind and with most engine features not available (originally rendered with OpenGL). Splitscreen mutliplayer was added with less than a weeks worth of time. Later the project was converted to DX11 the same time the engine was being converted to DX11 in a week. Much later networking was added on top of the game in a week. These quick iterations (and lack of knowledge and experience early on) lead to the mess. For more accurate look at my code see Roguelike!
