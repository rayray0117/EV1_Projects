Known issues:
Don't press a number if a shader/texture wasn't loaded to that number. Havven't tried it out but know it will be bad.


How To Use:
L = print config list to Debugger Output window
K = set some config stuff that isn't really being used to some other values to test out the set functions in Config

Hold S and use numbers 0-9 to use shaders loaded from config
Hold T and use numbers 0-9 to use textures loaded from config
